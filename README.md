# Web Scrapper - PDF and Page Text

This application uses the Puppeteer library in node.js to scrape data from websites.

It will save a full PDF of the selected website and save the text from the defined page division id.

It requires Puppeteer and FS be installed.

The application can also run on a timer, but the node server must stay open for it to run properly.
